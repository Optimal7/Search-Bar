# Simple Search Bar
Here is a really simple search bar I made in Python, with Tkinker (First program I made with this!)
It is just a very stupid thing I made. (I don't know why)

You can use this to copy and paste links into a search box and it will open the link in Chrome. (When you can do it yourself in 3 seconds)

## Setup
To use this mess of a project you just need to download [Python](www.python.org/downloads/).

## Note
I don't know why I made this in the first place, I was just very bored and decided to mess around with Tkinker.
I feel good about the result since its my first program with it.

## Other
If you would like to contribute to this ~~useless~~ project you can simply make a Pull Request and improve this, if you would like to.

And also if you use this project make sure to credit me.
